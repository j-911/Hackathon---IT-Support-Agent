## Checklist for Password Reset Guide:
This guide provides the general steps for resetting a password for most online accounts or services.

1. Find the "Forgot Password" or "Need help?" Link
On the login page for the account you want to access, look for a link or button that says something like "Forgot Password?", "Trouble logging in?", or "Need help?". This is the standard entry point for the password reset process.

2. Enter Your Account Information
You will be prompted to enter information to verify your identity. This is typically the username or email address associated with your account. After entering the correct information, click "Submit" or "Continue."

3. Verify Your Identity
To ensure your account's security, the service will send a verification code or a password reset link to a trusted method of contact you have on file, such as:

Your registered email address.

Your phone number via text message (SMS).

A third-party authenticator app.

Check your email or phone for the code or link and follow the instructions provided.

4. Create a New Password
Once your identity is verified, you will be directed to a page where you can create a new password. Make sure your new password is strong and unique. A strong password should:

Be at least 12 characters long.

Combine a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid personal information like birthdays, names, or common words.

After creating and confirming your new password, click "Reset" or "Save". You should now be able to log in to your account with your new password.
